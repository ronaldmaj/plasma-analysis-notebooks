# plasma-analysis-notebooks
In this repository you will find a number of Jupyter Notebooks that can analyse the .csv files we have from the Oscilloscope and Spectrum Analyzer.

## Reading_Cleaning_Displaying_Data-2018-10-04.ipynb
In this Notebook you can see the process I have gone through to take the .csv files created by the Rigol DSA710 Spectrum Analyzer and extract only the necessary data to create plots of the spectrum, including identifying any peaks.

## Signal_Analysis_Oscilloscope-2018-10-04.ipynb
This Notebook extracts data from the .csv file created by the Tektronix 2024B DSO (Digital Storage Oscilloscope) to create a plot, measure the peak-to-peak voltage and frequency and calculate the gain.
